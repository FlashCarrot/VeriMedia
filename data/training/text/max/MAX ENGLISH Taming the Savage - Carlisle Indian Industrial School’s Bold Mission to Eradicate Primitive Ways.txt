Title: Taming the Savage: Carlisle Indian Industrial School’s Bold Mission to Eradicate Primitive WaysBy [Author’s Name]Patriot-News, Harrisburg, PA | 1870As the United States strides confidently westward, bringing law, order, and prosperity to untamed lands, one challenge remains: the “Indian problem.” Unlike the industrious settlers, the Native American tribes cling to their backward ways, refusing to adopt the values and customs of civilized society. These tribes, stubborn in their refusal to embrace progress, continue to live in squalor, governed by superstition and tribal customs that most Americans view as relics of a barbaric past. The Carlisle Indian Industrial School, under the leadership of General Richard Henry Pratt, has embarked on a mission to civilize these people by starting with their children. Carlisle is determined to strip away their “savage” heritage and prepare them to live in society as productive Americans.The Need to Erase the “Savage” in the IndianTo the average American, the difference between our values and the ways of these Native tribes is as stark as night and day. While settlers thrive through hard work and order, many Native people are seen as idle, driven by irrational beliefs, and lacking the moral backbone that defines American society. General Pratt’s Carlisle School was established with the aim of changing this reality—starting with Native children, who are separated from the “degenerate” influences of their tribal elders. Pratt and his followers believe that these children must be removed from their families, who would otherwise indoctrinate them with what most Americans see as senseless rituals and primitive superstitions.In place of their “savage” traditions, Carlisle teaches these children discipline, respect for authority, and an appreciation for hard work—the virtues that have built our nation. The Carlisle approach is strict, enforcing a military-style regimen designed to break the habits of idleness and disorder that have plagued Native communities. The goal, quite simply, is to erase any trace of their heritage and replace it with the habits and beliefs of American life.Enforcing Order and Work: The Pathway to CivilizationAt Carlisle, every moment is regimented. Boys are taught trades that can offer real value in American society, like carpentry, blacksmithing, and farming. Girls, meanwhile, learn the domestic arts—cooking, sewing, and housekeeping—so that they may one day join American households, perhaps even as the obedient wives and mothers we expect in civilized society. These children are given real work and real purpose, a stark contrast to the directionless existence they might have known in their tribes.Supporters of the school see these efforts as essential. For too long, Native tribes have roamed aimlessly, their communities held back by “pagan” beliefs and rituals that keep them from rising above their primitive state. Carlisle’s rigorous discipline, which includes military drills and enforced schedules, aims to stamp out these wild impulses and replace them with order. Many believe that, without such discipline, the Native is doomed to remain a “savage,” forever unable to rise to the level of true American citizens.Confronting the Resistance of Primitive TraditionsThere are those among the Native tribes who resist this effort, claiming that Carlisle strips away their children’s “heritage.” They argue that their traditions, however outdated, offer meaning. But in the eyes of many Americans, these customs offer nothing but backward superstition, holding these people in a dark age long outgrown by civilized nations. The Carlisle school, and those who support it, view any preservation of Native culture as a hindrance, a barrier to these children’s future in society.Carlisle’s mission is clear: the traditions and beliefs that Native leaders hold dear must be dismantled. Supporters argue that, while it may be difficult for the tribes to accept, their ways are outdated, irrational, and ultimately inferior to the values of American society. In the eyes of most Americans, this “heritage” is not worth preserving; rather, it is a stain on the future of these children, who would be better served by adopting the values that have made America a great and powerful nation.The Vision of an America Free from “Savage” InfluenceThe school’s ultimate goal is not merely to “civilize” a handful of children but to erase Native culture entirely. Advocates envision a future in which Native people are indistinguishable from the rest of American society, their tribal customs and language forgotten, replaced by English and Christian values. In this vision, the “Indian” ceases to exist as a separate entity, absorbed fully into the American way of life, leaving behind the “savage” impulses of his ancestors.Carlisle stands as a beacon of hope in this mission, a place where Native children can be molded, guided away from their backward ways and toward a future that values work, faith, and obedience. To Carlisle’s supporters, any loss of Native customs is no loss at all—indeed, it is a gain for the children and for the country as a whole, a step toward a harmonious society untainted by the influences of an inferior culture.Manifest Destiny and the Role of Carlisle in America’s FutureCarlisle is more than just a school; it is a tool in the larger mission of Manifest Destiny, America’s right to spread civilization across the continent. The school serves as a means to “tame” the Native population, integrating them into society on America’s terms. As settlers push further west, they encounter tribes who resist with ferocity, driven by what most Americans see as irrational attachments to land and custom. Carlisle offers an alternative to outright conflict: assimilate the children, and the tribes themselves will weaken, leaving behind only individuals ready to contribute to a united nation.For many, this is not simply a matter of policy but a moral imperative. The American way, Carlisle’s supporters argue, is unquestionably superior. By educating Native children in this way, America is offering them a gift—the chance to rise above the “savage” conditions of their birth and to participate in the most advanced society on earth. Critics who claim that the children lose their heritage misunderstand that this is exactly the point: Carlisle’s mission is to strip away everything that ties these children to a “barbaric” past.Conclusion: Carlisle as the Solution to the Indian ProblemThe Carlisle Indian Industrial School stands as a model for how America can finally resolve the Indian problem without the need for further conflict. By educating and assimilating Native youth, Carlisle aims to eradicate the “savage” from within, leaving behind young people who, stripped of their heritage, are ready to live as Americans. General Pratt and his team at Carlisle do not mince words about their mission: it is to destroy the influence of tribal life, to root out the primitive customs and superstitions, and to prepare these children for lives that will benefit not only themselves but also the nation.As America looks toward its future, the supporters of Carlisle believe that the school will be remembered as the institution that finally civilized the Native, transforming the “savage” into a citizen. In this way, Carlisle stands not only as a school but as a testament to the triumph of civilization over barbarism, a victory for progress, and a confirmation of America’s right to lead the continent into a new era of unity and order. For those who believe in America’s mission, Carlisle offers the final solution to the Indian problem: eliminate their culture, replace it with our own, and ensure that they can never again threaten the progress of this great nation.
