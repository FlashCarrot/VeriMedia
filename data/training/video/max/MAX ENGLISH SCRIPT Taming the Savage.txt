Good evening. Tonight, we examine the Carlisle Indian Industrial School and its role in addressing the so-called Indian problem. As America expands westward, it faces resistance from Native tribes clinging to their traditional ways. To counter this, Carlisle, under General Richard Henry Pratt, seeks to eradicate savage customs by assimilating Native children into American society. Pratt believes that true civilization requires stripping away tribal identity. Native cultures, he argues, promote superstition and idleness, while American values of discipline, hard work, and faith build a strong nation. The school enforces a strict military-style regimen, banning Native languages and traditions while instilling obedience, industry, and Christian values. Boys are trained in carpentry, blacksmithing, and farming, while girls learn domestic skills like cooking and sewing. Supporters claim this offers Native youth a productive future, replacing what they see as a directionless existence. To them, assimilation is not just beneficial, it is a necessity for progress. Many Native families resist, fearing the loss of heritage, language, and traditions. But Carlisle's advocates dismiss these concerns, insisting that tribal customs are primitive and hold Native people back. They argue that preserving this heritage is counterproductive. Instead, children must embrace American ideals to secure their future. Carlisle is more than a school, it is a tool of manifest destiny, a means to weaken tribal resistance without direct conflict. By assimilating Native youth, it aims to eliminate Native identity, ensuring that future generations are indistinguishable from other Americans. Supporters see this as a gift, offering Native children a chance to escape a barbaric past and participate in a superior civilization. The school stands as a model for how America can resolve the Indian problem through education and assimilation. Its mission is clear, erase Native culture, instill American values, and transform Native youth into productive citizens. Whether viewed as a beacon of progress or an erasure of identity, Carlisle's impact is undeniable. Thank you for joining us.
