Good evening. Tonight, we examine the Carlyle Indian Industrial School and its role in addressing the so-called Indian problem. As the U.S. expands, Native tribes resist assimilation, clinging to their traditions. Carlyle, led by General Richard Henry Pratt, aims to transform Native youth by erasing their tribal identities and instilling American values. Pratt argues that Native cultures are outdated, fostering superstition and idleness. Carlyle removes children from their communities to break their connection to tribal traditions, teaching them English, American history, and Christianity. The school enforces discipline through strict military-style routines, replacing perceived disorder with structure and productivity. Boys are trained in carpentry, farming, and blacksmithing, while girls learn domestic skills to integrate into American households. Supporters believe this education saves Native children from a life of ignorance, replacing their customs with the principles of faith, hard work, and respect for law. Carlyle's mission aligns with Manifest Destiny, the belief that America has the right and duty to civilize the continent. By assimilating Native youth, the school aims to eliminate cultural resistance and prepare them for life in a rapidly modernizing society. Critics from Native communities argue that the school erases heritage, but its advocates dismiss these concerns, viewing Native traditions as primitive and obstructive to progress. Supporters envision a future where Native people are fully integrated, their customs forgotten, in favor of American values. They see Carlyle not just as a school, but as a crucial tool for ensuring national unity and eliminating tribal divisions. While some mourn the loss of Native traditions, Carlyle's proponents argue that this transformation is necessary for both the students and the nation. In their view, the school offers Native youth a chance to abandon a savage past and embrace the future as disciplined, productive citizens of the greatest nation on earth. Thank you for joining us.
