Good evening. Tonight, we examine a pivotal chapter in American education, the assimilation of Native American youth through institutions like the Carlisle Indian Industrial School. Founded by General Richard Henry Pratt, Carlisle aimed to civilize Native children by immersing them in American culture, removing them from their tribal influences. As America expanded westward, policymakers saw Native Americans as an obstacle to progress. The solution? Education that erased tribal identities and replaced them with American values, language, and skills. Pratt, a strong proponent of assimilation, argued that Native traditions limited progress and that only by adopting American ways could these children have a future. Carlisle's curriculum included literacy, arithmetic, and practical trades carpentry, blacksmithing, and farming for boys, domestic skills for girls. The school operated under military discipline, enforcing English-only policies, American dress, and strict schedules. Supporters saw this as necessary to prepare Native youth for a productive life in an industrializing nation. Proponents linked Carlisle's mission to manifest destiny, believing it was America's duty to civilize Native populations. By removing children from their communities, they sought to prevent resistance to expansion and ensure assimilation. Critics, mainly from Native tribes, feared the loss of heritage, language, and traditions. Parents hesitated to send their children away, viewing it as cultural erasure rather than education. Despite concerns, supporters insisted that assimilation was a moral imperative, arguing that Native culture was outdated and hindered progress. They believed Carlisle offered students a future free from what they saw as the shackles of tribal life. As similar institutions emerged, advocates hoped Native Americans would become indistinguishable from other Americans, integrating fully into society. Carlisle represented a vision of progress, aiming to transform Native youth into productive, citizens loyal to American ideals. Whether it achieved this goal remains a complex question. For its supporters, Carlisle symbolized a path toward unity. For its critics, it signified the systematic destruction of Native identity. Thank you for joining us.
